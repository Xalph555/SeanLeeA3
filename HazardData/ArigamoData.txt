Arigamo
Smells like death and corruption.
#
Hi, you are looking right into the blood red eyes of the Arigamo.
Can you run? Not a chance.
#
Yes, you were brutally eaten.
#
You hear a deathly scream followed by a sudden drop in corruptive energy.
#
A dense blood-red corpse lies on the ground.
#
The ruin walls shake.
#
You feel your life force being drained.
