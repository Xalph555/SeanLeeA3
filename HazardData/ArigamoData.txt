Arigamo
You feel as if a large beast is nearby - it smells like death and corruption.
#
As you enter the room, you suddenly freeze as you hear a loud growl and the feeling
of sharp spines gently touching you. Something moves in front as you are greeted by
cold blood red eyes.
#
You feel as if a thousand spears have been plunged into your body as you limbs are
gradually torn off. You pass away with the corruption sinking deep into your soul.
#
You hear a deathly scream followed by a sudden drop in corruptive energy.
#
A dense blood-red corpse lies on the ground.
#
The ruin walls shake.
#
You feel your life force being drained.
