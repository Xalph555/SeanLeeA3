Dark Knight
You hear the sound of heavy armour moving.
#
A towering black armoured warrior stands before you. It seems to be 
looking for a fight.
#
Although you took significant damage, you were able to defeat the knight.
#
You hear a loud gasp and grunt followed by the sound of metal being shred.
#
Scaps of black armour can be found on the ground in a pool of blood.
#
An unconscious knight lies against a wall.
