Dark Knight
You hear the sound of heavy armour moving.
#
A towering black armoured warrior stands before you. It seems to be looking for a fight.
#
The dark warrior takes a swing with their mighty sword which just barely misses you.
Thinking quickly, you pick up a small sword that so happens to be lying nearby and
engage in a tense battle with the knight. Swings and slashes were exchanged, and in
the end, although you took significant damage, you were able to defeat the knight.
#
You hear a loud gasp and grunt followed by the sound of metal being shred.
#
Scaps of black armour can be found on the ground in a pool of blood.
#
An unconscious knight lies against a wall.
