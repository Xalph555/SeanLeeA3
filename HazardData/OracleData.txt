Corrupted Oracle
You feel a presence that is both friendly yet dark.
#
You see a lone girl meditating. It seems like the darkness is embracing her gently.
#
The girl looks at you for a second, but pays you no mind.
#
You hear a sharp painful scream and feel the corruption grow heavier.
#
A pile of robes lie in a pool of blood. Looks like they belong to a fortune-teller
of sorts.
#
The girl pays you no mind.
