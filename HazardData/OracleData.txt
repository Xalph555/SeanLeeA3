Corrupted Oracle
You feel a presence that is both friendly yet dark.
#
You see a lone girl meditating in the centre of the room. It seems like the 
darkness is embracing her gently and an odd white glow seems to be emitting from her.
Light and darkness intertwine her being.
#
The girl looks at you for a second, but pays you no mind.
#
You hear a sharp painful scream and feel the corruption grow heavier.
#
A pile of robes lie in a pool of blood. Looks like they belong to a fortune-teller
of sorts.
#
The girl pays you no mind.
