Bottomless Pit
You feel a storng draft.
#
You walk into the room and then feel like you are suddenly entering it vertically.
Darkness surrounds you as you fall deeper and deeper until you collide with the ground,
breaking your legs and spine.
#
You have fallen down a bottomless pit. No one is around to save you and your journey
ends here.
