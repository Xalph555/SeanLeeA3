Outcasted Raiders
It sounds like there is a group of rowdy people in the next room.
#
It seems like you have intruded on a meeting amongst a group of outcasts as they
savour the feeling of corruption flowing through the air. They are oddly attuned
with it and clearly find your interruption offensive.
#
Before you could react, you were grabbed and tossed around the room between the
members as they each take a swing at you. After everyone has had their share,
you are thrown through a random exit.
#
A choir of screams can be head in the distance.
#
A small pile of discarded limbs can be seen on the ground.
