Suspicious Trader
One of the rooms feels negotiable.
#
You see a trader with a variety of items laid out, but clearly the corruption has
tainted his mind as no sane person would expect business to be blooming in an
abandoned ruin. He gestures for you to come towards him.
#
Cautiously, you approach the man as he begins explaining the different things he
has on offer. Somehow you were convinced to enter a random trade. Was it for items
or nothing at all? For some reason, you are unable to remember exactly.
#
You hear a scream and the sounds of many items falling on the ground.
#
A large bag sits on the ground filled with a managled corpse.
