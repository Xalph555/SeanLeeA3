Dilapidated Study
#
Dust and cobwebs line the ceiling of this long-forgotten study. There are
some ink wells and quills on top of an old desk that has not seen its owner
for quite some time. Some torn paper and books are scattered on the ground
but they are of no interest to you. It seems that some scholars use to use
this room.

Ransacked Library
#
Empty shelves are all you see with piles of disturbed dust clumped together
in bunches where books and documents used to be. The table and chairs are also
turned over and broken. It seems like this place was raided recently.

Foul Smelling Common Room
#
The stench of sweat and rotting fruit hangs heavy in the air. The people who
occupied this area clearly were not fond of cleaning. There are towels hanging
in odd places, bowls of off-meals left sitting in crates, and a pile of rat 
waste in the corner.

Ominous Prayer Room
#
It is clear that this was once a place of worship and hope where people gathered
and prayed for all manner of things. Although one would not be able to tell at
first glance as the corruption clouds this room and has severely damaged the
artifacts that were once symbols of peace.

Haunted Hallway
#
You find yourself in a long dark hallway; wooden floors dusty and brick walls stained.
It is eerily silent, but you still feel someone's presence. It's not the typical
presence of a normal person however, and if feels as if it is embedded into the hallway
itself. Despite this, there is no hostility aside from those roaming within the ruins.

Airy Study
#
A draft of wind can be felt as you enter the room. There are small holes in the ground
as well as several in the ceiling. Loose pages from open books flutter around the study
as a result, and the dust in the air trace out the path of the wind. It almost looks
like a winter wonderland, although the damning effect of the corruption spoils the mood
with its sinister aura.

Intimidating Entrance
#
You stand in a lobby of sorts with bricks and pieces of timber scattered along the ground.
There are large claw marks along the walls and the floor, like some beast was marking its
territory. The corruption feels at its weakest here.

Open Courtyard
#
You come out to an open area where the moonlight shines down on you. The corruptive mist
tints the light with a purple haze colouring a mood which could only be described as evil.
There are some withered greenery around the courtyard and litter can be seen at almost every angle.

Corrupted Lab
#
Burners, bottles, pots and shelves full of odd ingredients. These are the first things
you see along with bright green tubes installed along the ceiling. It seems like this
place has been in use recently, although the puddles of blood and torn lab coats
suggests that the users passed recently too. Red quills are scattered along the ground.

Empty Equipment Room
#
The markings of armour, swords, and spears can be seen on the weapon racks and armour
stands, however the items themselves are nowhere to be seen. The toppled crates and
barrels suggest this place was raided.

Damp Guard's Quarters
#
Broken beds and torn clothes soaked on blood are draped along the walls. Foul smelling
mucus drips from the ceiling and the corruption lingers strongly here. There are also
crushed helmets with large claw marks through them.

Half-Collapsed Room
#
The room is narrow, not so much because of the construction of the room, but because
of the construction being broken. Wooden beams, pieces of wall, and uprooted floor
boards collectively make it a perilous area to pass through. However, it seems stable
for the most part.

Run-down Training Room
#
You feel the presence of old great warriors who once trained here. The past heroes
of the land, saints, kings, legends. The corruption is weak here oddly enough, and
you can almost see the outline of practiced figures moving in and out of the mist,
almost as if they were fighting a battle of their own. However, they are not real.

Repurposed Interrogation Chamber
#
An unsightly device rests in the centre of the room and almost looks like a chair
with a large spider stuck to the back of it. Various contraptions can be seen sprouting
from the ends of various arms. To add to that, there are also chains, and blades scattered
along the ground that is also stained red. There is a lone mop and bucket in the corner.

Cold Creepy Cells
#
There is an odd chill that can be felt here. Not only is it cold, but the presence of the
room is one of authority and cool twisted justice. Cuffs and straw beds are common
in each of the barred sections of this space, although one looks like is has been torn
apart with an old pile of bones occupying it.

Mysterious Garden
#
The corruptions flows freely here, and the plants are not withered surprisingly. Bright
purple flowers can be seen and almost feel hot when you put your hand near them. Best
not to touch them however.

Corpse-filled Assembly Hall
#
The smell of blood and rotting corpses is strong here, as well as a heavy feeling of
corruption. Piles and piles of torn off flesh and bone paint the floor, and you can
almost hear the sound of the Ariagmo feasting still reverberating against the walls.

Blood-stained Classroom
#
It seems the Arigamo frequents this area too. Large footprints and claw marks can be
seen along the ground and on the upturned tables and chairs. The blackboard also has a
large and long cut across it. The corruptive mist is almost toying with you as you can
hear the chants of an old school anthem.

Dusty Hallway
#
By far one of the dustiest rooms you have come across. The amount of dust swirling in
the air is almost suffocating and makes it difficult to see anything. It might be best to
pass through as quickly as possible.

Rotten Kitchen
#
Broken stoves, counters, and pans can be seen scattered and lodged in the walls. All the
cupboards are open and appear to have been ransacked. The cold room is also open, and the
stench of rotting meat is being strongly emitted from it.
