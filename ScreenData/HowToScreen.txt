 You enter the Abandoned Ruins with; an Enchanted Crossbow, a few crossbow Bolts,
 a Protective Censer to ward off corruption, a limited amount of Incense Sticks,
 a Map, and a Telecard.

 To achieve your goal, you must kill the Arigamo and retrieve the Fuhai gem from it.
 Be alert, the gem can be taken from a dead Arigamo by anyone roaming the ruins. While
 the Arigamo does spend most of its time asleep, it can be woken up by a stray crossbow
 Bolt or others entering its room. It can move around too.

 You can only remain in the Ruins so long as you have Incense Sticks for your censer - otherwise
 the corruption will start to eat away at you. Running out of Bolts will also force you to
 leave - you would not be able to defend yourself without a functioning crossbow.

 Be careful as you explore the 20 rooms of the Ruins as other various hazards are
 present. Bottomless pits and Colonies of corrupted rats are natural and are bound to
 their room, however other people wonder around; Oracles, Thieves, Raiders, Traders,
 and Knights. Some of these people may be hostile, but they are people who you must
 prevent, as much as possible, from meeting a gruesome end. You don't want more blood
 on your hands.

 Move around using the [MOVE <direction>] command with one of eight standard
 compass directions; [N, S, E, W, NE, SE, SW, NW].

 Shoot your crossbow Bolts into adjacent rooms using the [SHOOT <directions>]
 command, also using compass directions (e.g. Shoot N E S SE NW). Your enchanted
 crossbow allows you so specify 5 directions to form a path for the Bolt to travel,
 and it will provide some hints about each room it passes through. A random direction
 would be selected if it cannot move in a direction you specify. Be careful not to
 shoot yourself!

 Use the Telecard by using the [TELECARD <room number>] command, which will let you
 return to a room you have previously visited. You may only use the Telecard once.

 You can try to interact with your current room using the [INTERACT] command. Maybe
 something will happen.

 Bring up the Map using the [MAP] command.

 Bring up this Help menu using the [HELP] command.

 You can exit the game at any time using the [QUIT] command.
