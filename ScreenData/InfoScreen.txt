 It seems that you have made a grave mistake.

 Known as the mightiest beast tamer in the land, your last expedition led you 
 to seek out the Fuhai gem to awaken the Arigamo - a large, ancient lizard-like 
 beast; four stubby legs provide it with great stability while its thin elongated
 body allows it to be dexterous. Its twin tails are razor sharp, and coupled with 
 its large protruding teeth, makes it a truly formidable foe. Getting close to it
 would be extremely dangerous as thin blood-red quills line its back and limbs.

 During your expedition, you were able to retrieve the gem successfully and awaken
 the beast, however it immediately escaped taking the gem with it. You returned
 home empty handed but made the fatal assumption that all would be well. Over time,
 you heard reports of destroyed crops, death, and the native fauna being corrupted
 as the Arigamo has tapped into the hidden power of the gem used to awaken it. Many
 others have too, and now seek out the beast for fame and glory, or to take the dark
 power of the gem for themselves.

 This all started with you, and the weight of your actions have finally sunk in as you
 stand in front of a corruption-filled Abandoned Ruin where the Arigamo was last spotted.
 Armed with your trusty enchanted crossbow, you will atone for your actions by slaying
 the beast, retrieving the gem, and making sure no one else dies.
